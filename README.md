# Parallax Scrolling Website

To give my website depth, I used the parallax scrolling effect here.

## Installation & Usage
To check out my code, just clone the repository like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/zangelis/parallax-scrolling-website.git
cd parallax-scrolling-website
```
If you want to view the page in the browser, copy the path from index.html and paste it into the search bar.
